  abstract="Monte Carlo simulation is a core technology in computational statistics. Monte Carlo methods require numbers that appear to be realizations of random variables. Obtaining these numbers is the process called ``generation of random numbers''. Our objective is usually not to generate a truly random sample. Deep understanding of the generation process and strict reproducibility of any application involving the ``random'' numbers is more important. We often emphasize this perspective by the word ``pseudorandom'', although almost anytime we use a phrase similar to ``generation of random numbers'', we refer to ``pseudorandom'' numbers. The quality of a process for random number generation is measured by the extent to which the sample generated appears, from every imaginable perspective, to be a random sample (that is, i.i.d.) from a given probability distribution. Some methods of random number generation are better than others.",
