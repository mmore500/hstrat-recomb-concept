  \caption{
    Normalized quartet distances between reconstructed phylogenies and references distilled from tracked pedigree.
    Lower indicates less reconstruction error.
    Notches give bootstrapped 95\% CI.
    Horizontal blue line indicates expected quartet distance between random trees.
    Some reconstruction error is expected, especially in control treatment, due to resolution of effectively arbitrary phylogenetic structure among well-mixed population components (Section \ref{sec:phylogeny-extraction}).
