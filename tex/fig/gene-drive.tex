    Gene drive mechanism for species-level instrumentation.
    The larger of parents' differentia values at each layer is inherited.
    The largest value generated among layer 0 differentia ($a$) spreads from one member of generation 0 to sweep layer 0 within the population by generation 2.
    This mechanism applies to ``species-level'' instrumentation (Figure \ref{fig:annotation-types}).
