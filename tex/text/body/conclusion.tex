\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

Experiments confirmed the capability of proposed species-level and genome-level techniques were to enable inference of genealogical history, population size, and selection dynamics without centralized tracking.

The ultimate aim of this project is to facilitate application across diverse, large-scale digital evolution systems to enhance diagnostic telemetry, increase scientific observability, and enable application of phylogeny-aware evolutionary algorithms.
To this end, open source, plug-and-play software implementation of hereditary stratigraphy algorithms and data structures --- including those developed in this work --- will remain a core priority.
Ample opportunity exists for fruitful collaborations with digital evolution practitioners to tailor applications of hereditary stratigraphy to particular target evolutionary systems and underlying hardware.
