\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Genealogical Inference}

\input{fig/species-example-replicates}

Figure \ref{fig:species-example-replicates} compares phylogenetic trees reconstructed from to corresponding references extracted from perfectly-tracked sexual pedigrees.
For treatments with meaningful phylogentic structure --- the ``allopatry'' and ``ring'' treatments --- phylogenetic reconstruction from species-level annotation largely succeeded in recovering membership in structured subpopulations and the historical relationships between subpopulations.
In fact, for the ``allopatry'' treatment, inner node time points appear to more closely track the true generational time frames of speciation events (at generation 100 and 150) than the UPGMA-based pedigree distillation.
Adherence to the reference structure is somewhat weaker in the ring treatment than the allopatry treatment, perhaps due to ill-definedness of nontransitive phylogenetic distances expected due to genetic relatedness closing around the ring in both directions.
Reconstruction/reference comparisons for other replicates will be provided in supplemental material.

\input{fig/species-reconstruction-error}

Figure \ref{fig:species-reconstruction-error} shows distributions of reconstruction error for each treatment.

Across all three treatments, all ten replicate reconstructions exhibited quartet distance from reference was strictly less than 0.66, the expected quartet distance between random trees \citep{smith2020information}.
This provides strong evidence that some successful phylogenetic inference occurred in all three cases (exact binomial test, $p < 0.01$).

However, as expected, reconstruction quality on the bag population structure was marginal due to the lack of meaningful phylogenetic information to reconstruct.
Performance on the ring and allopatry treatments was stronger, achieving quartet distances between reconstruction and reference of around 0.3 in the typical case.
Inclusion of nebulous phylogenetic structure within the reference phylogeny (i.e., within well-mixed subpopulations in both ) seems likely to significantly contribute to reconstruction error, obscuring the true magnitude of meaningful reconstruction error due to limitations of the instrumentation-based approach.
More sophisticated pedigree-to-phylogeny conversion that collapses closely-related subpopulations to single nodes may prove more descriptive.

\subsection{Effective Population Size Inference}

\input{fig/ne-example-replicates}

Figure \ref{fig:ne-example-replicates} compares 10-sample running estimates of population size among one replicate from each surveyed treatment (Section \ref{sec:population-size-inference-experiments}).
Estimate trajectories from other replicates will be made available in supplemental material

All effective population estimates generally appear to respond to underlying demographic changes as expected, although the response to selection pressure relaxation appears somewhat weaker than responses to changes in population size, and orders-of-magnitude-spanning noise appears across all treatments.

\input{fig/ne-estimate-distributions}

Figure \ref{fig:ne-estimate-distributions} summarizes the distribution of effective population size estimates across replicates at three time points spread across the beginning, middle, and end of evolutionary runs.
Estimates differ significantly across time points within all non-control treatments, confirming population size estimator sensitivity to underlying changes in population size and selection pressure ($p < 0.05$, non-overlapping confidence intervals).
For the bottleneck and selection pressure treatments, which involve reversion to initial conditions, distributions of the first and last time points are comparable, as expected.

\input{fig/ne-detection-matrix}

Figure \ref{fig:ne-detection-matrix} summarizes the detectability of underling $N_e$ changes.

Detection was performed using MLE confidnece interval comparison between rolling population size estimates at different time points and Mann-Whitney comparison of one-off population size estimate sets at different time points.

No false positives differences in effective population size are detected within the control treatment or same-timepoint comparisons within any treatment.
However, under the range expansion treatment, changes to population size from 10 to 66 is more readily detectable than changes earlier changes.
